# Routines

_This was inspired by_ [_this post_](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/wfh/) _in Rands in Repose by Michael Lott._ 

I've been thinking lots about how similar my days are, especially since the pandemic. Below is my daily schedule for a typical day of the week.

Alarm rings at 5:30am, only it's not an actual alarm but one of my kids who is awake and decided it was time for everyone to start the day. Now it's time to feed the kids, change their diapers, and get them dressed. I spend about an hour playing with them before the little ones head off to their first nap (it must be nice). It's about 8:15am, and I finally head off to work. Since working from home, my commute is 11 steps away to our camper trailer on the side yard.
I sit down and spend about 15 min, organizing my work for the day.

* Open Todos, review the rollover from the yesterday, add the urgent items only.
* Open Google Calendar, look for conflicts and what meetings I can skip/cancel. Once things are settled, I add some todos for any prep I'll need for those meetings.
* Open Gmail, quickly clear the noise, save the signal as unreads and read later.
* Open Slack, do the same ^. 

It's usually time to start my morning meetings which typically are back to back from 9-11am. I try to not multi-task in those meetings because (1) I am often the one running them or keeping them on course (2) I want to maximize the quality of the time we spend. Once the meeting is accomplished, I'm typically the first to bow out. I try to skip the end-of-meeting banter to give me a few minute intermission before my next one. (IMO, meetings should start on time and guarantee to end on time or early.) If I stay long, it typically makes my entire schedule run behind.

Around 11am, I get a 90 minute stretch to get work done. I'll open my Todos and find a task that will take \~45 minutes. I'll take a brief break, answering some slack conversations, then take another 30 minute stretch to either finish up that work or begin work on the next task. Typically, I'll break for lunch from 12:30-1:00, which consists of 10 minutes for eating, 10 minutes for reading the news, and 10 minutes for responding to messages and prepping for my afternoon meetings.

After lunch, I begin my second long-stretch of meetings, typically from 1-3:30pm. Once those are complete, I spend 30 minutes to respond to any open threads (email, slack, etc). After that I spend the final 15 minutes prepping my schedule and planned work for the next day.

I typically sign off at 4:30 to spend time with the family. I've got 3 small kids at home who go to bed around 8pm. Once they are asleep, I clean things up around the house and then hop back online for a few hours. I try to knock-off a few more items from my Todos to reduce the amount of work that rolls over to the next day. I typically head to bed around 11:30pm.
