# Routines

Below is my daily schedule for a typical day of the week.

Alarm rings at 5:30am, only it's not an actual alarm but one of my kids who is awake and decided it was time for everyone to start the day. Now it's time to feed the kids, change their diapers, and get them dressed. I spend about an hour playing with them before the little ones head off to their first nap (it must be nice). It's about 8:15am, and I finally head off to work. Since working from home, my commute is 11 steps away to our camper trailer on the side yard. 
I sit down and spend about 15 min, organizing my work for the day. 
- Open todos, review the rollover from the yesterday, add the urgent items only.
- Open calendar, look for conflicts and what meetings I can skip/cancel. Once things are settled, I add some todos for any prep I'll need for those meetings.
- Open email, quickly clear the noise, save the signal as unreads and read later.
- Open slack, do the same ^.
It's usually time to start my morning meetings which typically are back to back from 9-11am. I try to not multi-task in those meetings because (1) I am often the one running them or keeping them on course (2) I want to maximize the quality of the time we spend. Once the meeting is accomplished, I'm typically the first to bow out. I try to skip the end-of-meeting banter to give me a few minute intermission before my next one. (IMO, meetings should start on time and guarantee to end on time or early.) If I stay long
