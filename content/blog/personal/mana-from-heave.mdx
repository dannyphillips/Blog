# Like mana from  Heaven

Our relationship to stuff is the like mana from heaven. So often, we find ourselves creating stockpiles, whether it’s because of personal greed or preparation for hard times to come. The thing is, there is never any point of contentment; with this attitude, there is a perpetual thirst for more that can never be quenched. The more you store, the more you feel you need; and the more you have, the more time and attention that stuff demands from you.   
  
**The more stuff you own, the more your stuff owns you!**

Rather than stockpiling, we should instead consider stuff as resources that fills needs. We should only gather the stuff we truly fills the needs we have today. With this perspective, it Quickly becomes evident there is a lot you don’t need. And for the needs you do have, it also becomes evident that often stuff is not the remedy, but rather God is. 

I believe “Stuff” is one of the subtle tactics the Enemy uses to dismay the church. It’s a distraction that starts small and innocent, but can quickly become the master that enslaves us to endless toil.
