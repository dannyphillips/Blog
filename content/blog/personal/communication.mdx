# Communication

### Background

When thinking about communication, the types of communication can easily be categorized by channel and cadence. The channel describes how the information is transcribed and cadence is the frequency of that communication. Generally speaking, most communications can be summarized through three main channels:

1. **Written:** Communication through composing words on a medium (usually paper).
2. **Verbal**: Communication through composing words through sounds.
3. **Visual:** Communication through composing ideas through images.

Likewise, the cadence of any communication exists on a continuum, based on the frequency:

1. **Synchronous:** High frequency, back-and-forth communication, often requiring active attention.
2. **Asynchronous:** Low-Medium frequency communication, that does not require any active attention.

Putting this all together, there is a simple matrix you can build, such that there are really 6 common types of communication.

    | | sync | async |
    | written | chat | document |
    | verbal | phone call | voice message |
    | visual | video call | video recording |

### Communications in the Wild

Often times, we tend to gravitate towards a few communication methods and rarely use others. Typically, it seems the easiest and most preferred styles are synchronous. This is because synchronous communications are typically fast-paced, require nearly no preparation and often result in closure the soonest. When comparing communication channels, many seem to prefer written as it is the least revealing. It requires sharing very little information of yourself and is one of the simplest forms of communication. However, in contrast, visual communication is also often favorited due to its ability to share high bandwidths of information so quickly. Communication is in its richest form and therefore can often be the fastest of communication tactics. 

Therefore, it should be no surprise that synchronous written (chat) and visual (video call) are the two most common forms of communication today. For instance, look at the business sector. Most employees at corporations spend a majority of their time on chat and video calls, which explains why there have been massively successful startups in this space in the past few years (Slack, Zoom). 

### Comparing Communications

Now that's consider the trade-offs for each communication tactic, since there are likely good reasons to choose one over the others. 

#### Channels

**Written:**

* Pros:
  * Primitive, with a low barrier to entry.
  * Requires the least active attention of any communication channel.

  Cons:
  * Can feel limiting to describe large, non-tangible concepts.
  * Low bandwidth communication
* Best uses:
  * Simple communications and/or situations where more complex communications don't exist.
* Worst uses:
  * Complex ideas where words don't provide enough detail or situations where speed is the utmost importance.

**Verbal:**

* Pros:
  * A nice balance between written and visual
  * Simpler than visual, but more rich than written.
* Cons:
  * Can sometimes be more difficult to understand than written or visual.
* Best uses:
  * Situations that are more complex or require more immediate feedback that written, without the added cost of visual communication.   .
* Worst uses:
  * Situations where written would suffice or visual is required.

**Visual:**

* Pros:
  * Simply convey complex concepts
  * High bandwidth communication
* Cons:
  * Requires the most active attention of any communication channel.
* Best uses:
  * Great for sharing complex ideas where simply words are not enough.
* Worst uses:
  * Simple, short communications that don't require much attention.

#### Cadences

**Synchronous:** 

* Pros:
  * Requires little preparation
  * High frequency, offers quick responses
* Cons:
  * Demands active attention, potential interruptions
  * Information is sometimes transient and can be lost
  * High-frequency, means little downtime for reflection between responses.
* Best uses:
  * Great for quick questions or easy decisions that need immediate response.
* Worst uses:
  * Ideas that require reflection or things that require a long-living artifact.

**Asynchronous:**

* Pros:
  * No demand on active attention, minimizing interruptions
  * Information is permanently captured
  * Low-frequency, offering long periods for reflection between responses.
* Cons:
  * Can require lots of preparation
  * Low frequency, with often slower responses
* Best uses:
  * Ideas that require reflection or things that require a long-living artifact.
* Worst uses:
  * Great for quick questions or easy decisions that need immediate responses.

### Choosing a Communication Strategy

Now using the rubric above, I think there are some clear optimizations that can be made. As stated above, businesses tend to gravitate towards synchronous communications, and in particular written and video channels, such as live chat and video conferencing. While they are often quite effective, they are also quite expensive. Not necessarily expensive in the time spent on them, while that can be optimized, but also in the opportunity cost.

To better explain this, let me break this down with a sample scenario.

The management team at work wants an update on a project. The manager initiates a live chat thread with his team. The team stops their work and responds to the chat. They chat back and forth about the various details of the project and spend several minutes clarifying misinterpretations and digging up supporting content to explain their ideas. After this exchange, the team spends a few minutes reflecting on that conversation and several more reorganizing their workspaces to get back to what they were doing. Later on, a sibling team requests a meeting to help clarify the teams roadmap to minimize the crossover between their work. This exchange follows a similar course and after several minutes the team, once again, tries to return back to their normal work.

While I realize it's a bit cliche to talk through a hypothetical situation, this does not feel too distant from a standard business day for most of us. While yes, both the management and sibling teams got the information they wanted, the primary team's productivity was net negative as a result. There has to be a better way!

Human nature is naturally impatient and self-focused, as you can clearly see that demonstrated with the communication tactics we gravitate towards, often reaching for synchronous communication. We look for the quickest way to solve our problems, without regard for the cost or impact on others. We'd rather ask someone directly than spend a few moments thinking on our own or searching for the answers. We'd rather drive a group to immediate decision than allow time and space for reflection.

Rather, what if in the previous situation, the team, knowing information about their work would often be requested, spent some time to document it. Then, instead, the management team could browse the documentation and send an email with any follow-ups that could easily be responded to when the team had a break a their day. Likewise, the sibling team likely was requesting much of the same information which they could discover in the documentation. It may even be sufficient, such that there is no need for any communication exchange at all. Not only would these approaches minimize the impact these parties have on the team. A small foresight and investment by the team, likely resulted in both parties getting their information in a much more timely and convenient manner.

### Closing Remarks

I'm convinced, we as humans, have lost the art of communication. With the rapid advancement of technology, more readily enabling synchronous communication, we've forgotten how to leverage the other types (and the realization that they still hold unique value). Moreover, businesses could save thousands of dollars by shifting more communication to be asynchronous. It would be great to see more prepared video recordings than live meetings and documentation than chat transcripts. Finally, more than the cost savings, the increase in focus and active attention is the price that is most valuable. Attention is something we all have a limited supply of and yet everyone (and thing) is desperate to take it from us. (For more, read my post on Attention: The Unspoken Currency). 

So next time your tempted to add a meeting to the calendar or send a quick chat message, ask yourself, "Do I really need this information now?" and "Is it worth taking some of their time to get this information or is there a way I can get it on my own?". You might be surprised what you find.
