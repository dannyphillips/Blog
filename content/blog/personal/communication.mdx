# Communication

When thinking about communication, the types of communication can easily be categorized by channel and cadence. The channel describes how the information is transcribed and cadence is the frequency of that communication. Generally speaking, most communications can be summarized through three main channels:

1. **Written:** Communication through composing words on a medium (usually paper).
2. **Verbal**: Communication through composing words through sounds.
3. **Visual:** Communication through composing ideas through images.

Likewise, the cadence of any communication exists on a continuum, based on the frequency:

1. **Synchronous:** High frequency, back-and-forth communication, often requiring active attention. 
2. **Asynchronous:** Low-Medium frequency communication, that does not require any active attention.

Putting this all together, there is a simple matrix you can build, such that there are really 6 common types of communication. 

    | | sync | async |
    | written | chat | document |
    | verbal | phone call | voice message |
    | visual | video call | video recording |
