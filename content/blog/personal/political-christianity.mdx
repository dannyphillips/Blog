America is in dire times. 2020 has been one horrendous year on so many fronts and with each week it only seems yet more bad news comes. From a global pandemic to economic recession or civil unrest to racial injustice, there has been a steady stream of turmoil. America's political powers couldn't be more divided. The world stage is more unstable than ever before, with China, Iran, and Russia all unified and stronger than ever. Unemployment is at a rate unseen in nearly a decade. Those in power seem unstoppable, while the rest are, despite their efforts, unable to make a difference. COVID has taken the lives of over 180,000 Americans and continues to steadily spread with no clear mitigation strategy or vaccine in sight. Heck, the country isn't even aligned on whether this virus is real and worth fighting. This is the world we live in. This is today.

With the stage set, the 2020 election seems to be on everyone's forefronts. Everyone seems to believe this outcome will be either the saving grace or the nail in the coffin, depending on whether it goes their way (Ironically, this is the sentiment from both sides about the other). Democrats blame Republicans for the oversight, Republicans blame Democrats for the overreaction. The leaders of both groups are sinister and about as far from genuine as they come. Both groups care more about their group "winning" at the cost of further dividing our country.

### So the question remains, as a Christian, how do we respond?

Which side gets your vote? According to history, the republican party feels like the natural choice, but the reality is arguments can be made it is equally as corrupt as the other. The democratic party traditionally is pro-choice and in support gay marriage. However, the GOP is in favor of refusing support for immigrants in need, weapons and strong military powers, and challenging movements for equality, such as Black Lives Matter. When I think about "What would Jesus say?" I can't help but assume he'd rebuke all these things. 

> **In my opinion, the right response is not picking the side with lesser evils, but rather picking no side and instead taking stances on issues.** 

First of all, we've allowed politics to define our day-to-day and our faith, rather than our faith define our politics. What I mean by that is lately, even for Christians, politics seem to have become more important than our faith. There is a tendency to become fixated on striking the right balance in the political system as a tactic for fixing the world around us. As Christians, though, we know the only thing that can fix this world is not any form of human "works", but rather through faith and working of the Holy Spirit.   
  
Secondly, when considering politics, it should be acknowledged that our political system is incredibly corrupt, driven by a thirst for power and greed. Regardless of who wins the election, I believe, the future for America will still be bleak. In fact, we know this because the Bible tells us so. In revelation, we know the world will continue to fall away until the end with justice has its course. There is no mention of "America" and despite what some may hope, we are no longer "One Nation under God". Real change does not happen through policy or a single leader. The Real change we need happens through conversations, relationships, and ultimately the Will of God. The way I see it, rather than focus our attention on trying to win us another few good years, it's better use of our time to ready ourselves. 

### **The storm clouds are coming, will you be ready?** 

> In Revelation 2, it says: "I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false. You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary."... "Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victorâ€™s crown." 

I know this is heavy, but the good news is it we don't have to do it alone. We are empowered with the Holy Spirit and are being equipped for what is in store for us. So, when it comes to politics and the upcoming election, it's true the next presidency, regardless of who wins, will likely create waves of change for all of us. However, I think it's important to have the right perspective. Remember it's not about picking a side, but more about connecting with those around you on the causes Jesus would support. We our called to love our neighbors as ourselves. While casting a vote is still okay, let's not stop there. Spread some love to those around you, support those in need, and be the voice for those that have no voice. 

As Christians, we are also warned it's a life of persecution. This world is not our home, so don't get comfortable, but let's embrace the uneasiness of the future and engage in the work Christ is doing all around us.
