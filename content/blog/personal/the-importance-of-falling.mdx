There's a cultural phenomena when fixated on success it also creates a sense of shame for failure. I believe this is one of the biggest mistakes we can make - to fear failure.

This has been something I've had convictions about for a while, but it wasn't until I was watching my son learn to walk that it hit me. You see, when we are young, we were constantly learning. Each day there was something new to discover or something to grow to do better. The thing is, you can't really have learning without failure. Failure is a critical step in the learning process. What I realized, when watching my son waddle around and then plop to the ground is nearly every attempt ended with a fall, not because he wasn't getting better but because he was always testing his limits. As we get older, many of the things we didn't know, we've now come to master. Moreover, with the myriad of mastered skills, many tend to learn less often and likewise rarely experience failure, at least that's the goal. Most adults prefer to do what they are good at and stay in their comfort zone, especially since by now it's often plenty big enough to accommodate everything they do on a daily basis.
