A technical unpacking of the learning curve

The term "Learning Curve" has become popularized and typically relates to the experience of learning something new. To better understand it, here is a way of thinking about it.

The skills that a person has today are at a certain level, for things they are proficient at (for instance walking) the level is relatively high, whereas for something they havent done before (like doing a backflip), they may be quite low.

The gap between these two skills can be considered the skills gap.

Now a brief sidebar about the learning process. Learning typically occurs through repetition, whereby we take a known fact/skill then build on it. It's a continuous cycle of testing and validating. For the case of knowledge, learning to read is often done by finding a word you dont know but inferring its meaning based on the words around it that you do know. For skills, such as learning to run, is often done by first learning to walk, then increasing your pace until you start picking up your feet more rapidly.

When we are learning, we use this process of testing and validating to slowly bridge the skills gap. We try something then see if it resulted in getting us closer to our desired goal. If it did, we'll try to do it again but with a new twist for even greater improvement. If it was not succesful, we'll try something different next time. Through this process of iteration, we continue to revise our startegy and narrow the search for the skill.

### So what's the science behind this?

With each iteration, our brains are making connections between nuerons. The successful cases are often tried again, and therefore creating more connections between those same neurons, reinforcing the positive pathways. It's these strongly defined neurological pathways that support skill development. Mature skills have well defined pathways due to the precise repetition, whereas foreign skills have very little neurological definition, if any, which explains why it is so hard to do something new for the first time.

### Back to the curve

As we perform this iterative learning process, desperately trying to close the skills gap, it takes time. When you combine the size of the gap with the time it took to close it, you have described what is called “the learning curve”. As it’s name implies, it’s often curved, in that for some skills the initial progress shows strong improvement but closing the final section of the gap can take a while. Alternatively, other skills may show no promise for a long time the  rapidly improve towards the end. These varying shapes are all potential types of learning curves. Learning curves can vary by skill, environment, and individual.

### So how does this relate to technology

When we look at machine learning, it typically follows many of the same process. A software program (model) is capable of doing very little at first. There is a desired skill to be learned, so it is put through a suite of iteration, often thousands or millions of cycles. In each iteration, it tries something, validates whether it achieved the desired outcome, and then adjusts its next move accordingly. This process is called “training the model”. Software is literally mimicking many of the biological learning sequences we see in life and making some connections, forming digital neural networks just like our brains do. Rather than needing to programmatically describe the nuances of every skill a machine should do, instead we can show the desired outcome and give the machine a suite of defined scenarios for it to train up its own understandings. This is what makes machine learning so powerful. Logic can be dynamically developed rather than statically coded. We’re only just beginning to see working applications, but the future possibilities are nearly limitless.
