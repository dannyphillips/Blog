Imagine for a minute if was a game. Not just any game, but one with ultimate reward for those that play it well. A game filled with adventure, hardship, laughter and sorrow. With paths that wind in every direction and countless decisions to make at each step. If life was a game, it would be the greatest of games and I imagine would go something like this.

## The Setup

Like every game, there is some amount of setup that occurs in order to put every piece on the map and give every player what they need to start. While most games have identical starting points for everyone, this game is quite different. Players start at positions all across the board. Some have no resources while others have many. Some have clear advantages and yet others start at a loss and have nothing but uphill battles in front of them. This a the world we live in, where the hands were not dealt evenly and everyone has to play the hand they were dealt.
