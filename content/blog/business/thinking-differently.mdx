###### How to avoid following the status quo and find true innovation through first principle thinking

Innovation is the process of making something new. When considering the next thing to build, a common practice is to research what has already been done to learn from past mistakes. While this is a helpful mechanism for quickly summarizing years of work, there is some danger in relying too heavily on industry research for fear of following the status quo. The more you immerse yourself in previous ways of doing something, the more you get shrouded in the problems they faced and trapped in the previous ways of thinking. Ultimately, this limits the potential for innovation to nothing better than minor enhancements and improvements. I call this “Copycat Innovation”.

Take for instance, the automotive industry. For decades, the automotive companies have been referencing each other’s work, even poaching employees to bring those ideas with them. What we’ve seen is one company releases a feature and it’s not too long before another company does the same thing (although sometimes in a slightly different way). Over time, despite their being many players in the industry, their products have converged and become commoditized. For consumers, each year the improvements made to any vehicle line are marginal and generally similar across brands. Not much has changed in vehicles since they were first built 50+ years ago, that is, until Tesla joined the scene.

They took a much different approach. Rather than looking at their competitors and finding ways to improve, they went all the way back to the initial problem statement. They looked for a better means of transportation, realizing the real limitation was in the energy source. By choosing electric, the solution became quite simpler and many of the traditional problems automotive manufacturers faced simply melted away. Electric cars don’t have to include things like transmissions, drive shafts, hydraulic pumps, etc. Not only is their solution simpler, it also is more performant and sustainable. The electric cars from Tesla truly are the single biggest innovation the automotive industry has see in 50+ years. Now, every vehicle manufacturer is copying them, as they have redefined what a car is.

As this anecdote so clearly illustrates, often the best solutions come from looking at first principles. Going back to the starting point and reconsidering all the potential options, many of which have been ignored. Often the best answers are there, but no one is looking for them. If you truly want to make change, copycat innovation will not get you there. Rather than using industry research as a starting point, the best innovation often is found when industry practice is ignored. For the treasure is hidden where no one is looking.

You know you've truly done something remarkable when the product sells itself. The best products require no marketing, whereas copycat innovations rely solely on marketing as the differentiator. Below are some of the most disruptive innovations of the past few decades, each of which ignored what their competitors were doing and instead looked holistically at the problem to find an even better solution.
