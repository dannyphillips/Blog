### Background

My kids are in that phase where they regularly learn new words. It seems like everyday they are learning a new one. This got me interested to see if I could track their words by day.

### Summary

An app that tracks when a baby learns a new word, letting you filter words by date and visually see the growing vocabulary of your child.

### How it works

The app is built with React and powered by Firebase for hosting and a database. 

### Take Aways

* Firebase is an incredible toolset that is easy to use and quick to setup.

### Next Steps

* The UI is clunky and needs lots of work.
* Better search, sort, filter functionality
