### Background

I love learning. Often you can't know what to learn until you know what you don't know.

### Summary

An app that tracks all the open questions and "knowledge gaps" you have. These are seeds for new leanrings.

### How it works

A simple UI added on top of Firebase, allows for quick data entry of new questions.

### Take Aways

* Firebase is super easy and powerful

### Next Steps

* Create a UI for browsing all "gaps" and searching/sorting/filtering them.
* Allow gaps to be answered or marked as complete
