### What it is
A personal blog and portfolio site.

### How it works
The danny-phillips app is powered by GatsbyJS as a static site generator. Content is written with a combination of markdown and react components (Thanks to MDX) which gets compiled into a static website. Gatsby also allows you to query metadata from markdown files via graphQL which I use for tagging pages.

### Take Aways
- Gatsby is a great tool for quickly building a static app. It also has a extensive plugin ecosystem for nearly every integration you can think of.
- Authoring content in MDX is simple, yet incredibly powerful
- Forestry provides a UI for authoring mdx files and modifying page metadata, making it easy to update an MDX-powered site (even from your phone).

### Next Steps
- Gatsby is a bit bloated due to all the plugins, so I'd like to migrate to NextJS.
- Improve Global Search to support keyword/phrase matching as well as suggestions based on relevancy score.
