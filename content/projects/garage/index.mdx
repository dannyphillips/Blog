### Background

I regularly build apps, but don't have a great way to share them.

### Summary

An app for showcasing other apps including screenshots, links, summaries, etc. 

### How it works

This app was built with gatsby and later migrated to my personal portfolio (https://dannyphillips.me).

### Next Steps

* Convert the static site into a hosted application that allows users to create profiles and organizations with their own suites of apps.
