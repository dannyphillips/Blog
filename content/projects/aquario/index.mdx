### Background

I'm a aquarium hobbyist and regularly nerd out on metrics. I thought it would be fun to build an app for tracking my aquarium metrics.

### Summary

Easily track recurring aquarium metrics including water properties (pH, nitrates, etc), fish properties (species, length, age, etc) and equipment properties (service date, etc).

### How it works

Prior to building this app, I was already tracking this data in a google spreadsheet. Because of this, I decided to use google sheets as a datastore for this application, allowing me to continue to use the spreadsheet or the application for viewing/modifying my datasets. I created a lean react app using a gatsby template to quickly bootstrap the UI.

### Take Aways

- Google sheets is a great option for a lean database.
- Gatsby's template library easily bootstraps UI for new apps.

### Next Steps

- Improve the UI so it is more appealing
- Add more features to record/modify the dataset from the app UI.
