### Background

I regularly learn new things, but find that i forget all the things I learned. This often resulted in learnings not being remembered longterm, because they weren't regularly recalled.

### Summary

An app that records your learnings when they happen (daily) and then regularly reminds you of them to improve your ability to recall them longterm (eg. flash cards).

### How it works

This is a simple react app powered by google sheets. It was setup as a slack bot that regularly asks for learnings, thanks to a cron job, and will post the slack responses in a google sheet. It also regularly, posts a digest of learnings to slack from the past week, month, and year.

### Take Aways

It was cool to build a slackbot and use cron.

### Next Steps

* Style the slack responses using thei UI SDK to provide better UX.
* Create a single app for viewing, sorting, filtering all recalls.
