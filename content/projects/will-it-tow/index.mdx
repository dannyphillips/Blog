### Background

Choosing the right-sized trailer and tow vehicle can be tricky. It's not as simple as just knowing the tow capacity. There are quite a few factors to consider. This app attempts to simplify that process by performing all the calculations for you.

### Summary
I decided to challenge myself to build this in 1 day. It's simple and works, but it not the prettiest.

This calculator works in three ways:  
1\. Input tow vehicle data and it will generate the maximum specs for a trailer.  
2\. Input trailer data and it will generate the minimum specs for a tow vehicle.
3\. Input both and it will determine the risk rating with this rig setup.

### How it works

This app will use a small predefined database of vehicle data to prepopulate the vehicle fields or allow user input. It will then determine some baseline specs for a trailer that can be suitably paired with the vehicle. Users can then use these data point to query prospective trailers. The app uses a predefined list of static trailer spec data.

### Take Aways

This app was built, first as a simple hobby project to more easily visualize and perform calculations as I shopped for a personal travel trailer. While the app is quite simple, it was used as a prototyping bed for some trialing out the entire vercel ecosystem. It uses next.js with now.sh (vercel) for automated deployments and hosting.

### Next Steps
This was a fun one-day build. Because it was built quicklyl, it still needs lots of UX improvements and has some bugs.
Rather than performing calculations against a static list, the app should be able to query vehicle and trailer data to prepopulate those fields based on a given model and year. There aren't great vehicle APIs today, but there are ways of aggregating this data into an API for its easy consumption.
