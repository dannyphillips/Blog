### Background

Choosing the right-sized trailer and tow vehicle can be tricky. It's not as simple as just knowing the tow capacity. There are quite a few factors to consider. This app attempts to simplify that process by performing all the calculations for you.

### Summary

This calculator works in three ways:  
1\. Input tow vehicle data and it will generate the maximum specs for a trailer.  
2\. Input trailer data and it will generate the minimum specs for a tow vehicle.

3\. Input both and it will determine the risk rating with this rig setup.
