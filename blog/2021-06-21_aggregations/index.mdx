### The Aggregation Age

In the modern age, the internet has become a tool that bring things together. Like never before, we're seeing connections made that were never possible. It's this connectedness that has created a shift in the modern business space. Technology-driven businesses are able to reach broader markets faster and with fewer resources. Companies pop-up and capture insane market-share resulting in hyper-growth. It's this market-share as well as the incredible unit economics that modern technology companies enjoy that has created a new age of business - the Aggregation Age.

First coined by Ben Thompson in "Aggregation Theory", aggregation is the trend where a company is able to dominate its entire market due to the improved efficiencies and unit economics of the internet. We live in a world where internet companies have become the behemoths in the business world. They've grown so large that they have begun to outgrow their market. Because these companies are so well funded, it has afforded them a few options:

1. Own the market - Buy up the competition
2. Diversify - As they look for future growth, they take their deep pockets into new industry, either to build something new or buy up the upcoming leader.
